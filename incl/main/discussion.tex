\chapter{Discussion}
Bitch i said what i said
In Chapter Who Knows? an experiment with an RC circuit was made where the capacitor was charged as discharged. The data from the experiment was compared with theoretical values. The theoretical model charges and discharges a bit faster than the measured data. Despite this deviation the theoretical and raw data fits almost identical, with an $R^2$ close to $1$.

In chapter Who Knows? a low- and high-pass filter was constructed. For the low-pass filter the voltage was measured across the capacitor and across the resistor for the high-pass filter. From the data the cut-off frequency was found to be $x Hz$ whereas the the theoretical cut-off frequency was $341.83 Hz$ something something.
