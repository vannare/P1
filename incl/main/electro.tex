\chapter{Basic circuit theory}
Electrical circuits are fundamental building blocks in, more or less, every electronic device you can think of. The simple act of flipping a switch, e.g. to turn on the light, completes an electrical circuit. The purpose of the circuit is to carry electrical current, either in an open or closed circuit. The electrical components in a circuit are typically resistors, capacitors,  switches, and an electrical 	source (a battery, for instance).
\\ 
In this chapter, if a function is assumed constant, it is denoted with capitalization of its original notation.

The different elements of the circuit can be divided into two categories: active and passive. Active elements supply energy to the system, e.g. a battery, whereas passive elements absorb energy, e.g. a light bulb. A circuit with a battery and a bulb can be represented in the following way.
\begin{figure}[H]
\input{fig/tikz/bulb}
\caption{A circuit with a battery and a light bulb}
\label{fig:bulb}
\end{figure} 
\noindent In figure \ref{fig:bulb} the active element is a battery, and the passive element is a light bulb. Charge is transported by the current from the positive terminal of the battery, through to the light bulb. The light bulb absorbs the energy from the charge, which is then transported to the negative terminal of the battery.

\section{Circuit diagrams}
Electrical circuits are visually represented in circuit diagrams. In addition to the above-mentioned elements, the circuit diagrams introduce three terms: nodes, branches, and loops. Elements are \textit{branches} i.e.  the voltage supply, resistors, capacitors, and the like. \textit{Nodes} connect the \textit{branches} of the circuit. Lastly, any closed path in the circuit, in which no node is encountered more than than once, is called a \textit{loop} \cite[page~32]{bcircuit}. An example of a circuit is shown below.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \input{fig/tikz/bcircuit}
 \caption{A circuit with a battery, three resistors and a light bulb}
\end{figure}

\noindent This circuit has five branches, which are shown marked in color: a battery (in blue), three resistors ($R_1, R_2,$ and $R_3$, in red), and the light bulb (in green). The three nodes of the circuit ($N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$) connect the branches. Additionally, there are three loops, all of which have the same starting and ending point, $V_{battery}$. The first loop passes through $R_2$ and $R_1$, and returns to the starting point. Similarly, the second loop passes through $R_3$ and $R_1$, and returns. The third, and final, loop runs through the light bulb, then $R_1$, and returns. 

\subsection{Kirchhoff's Laws}\label{Klaws}
\textbf{Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)}
\\
Observe a circuit up until a node, past which the path of the circuit splits in two. The current encountering the node does not accumulate (as it would e.g. in a battery). Instead, all electrons flowing to that node split up between the available paths, and continue to flow through the circuit. This is Kirchhoffâ€™s current law (KCL), which states that the algebraic sum of all currents in a node is equal to zero. 
\begin{align}
\sum_{j=1}^{N} i_{j}(t) = 0,
\end{align}
where $i_{j}(t)$ is the $j$'th current entering the node through branch $j$, with $N$ branches connected to the node. \cite[page~32]{bcircuit}

\textbf{Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL)}
\\
KVL states: In a circuit, the algebraic sum of all voltages in a loop is equal to zero. This can be expressed mathematically  as,
\begin{align}
\sum_{j=1}^{N} v_{j}(t) = 0,
\end{align}
where $v_{j}(t)$ is the voltage in the $j$'th voltage with $N$ voltages.\citep[page~34]{bcircuit}\\
