\section{Low-pass filters}
The purpose of a low-pass filter is to filter out unwanted high frequencies. Listening to a such tone brings out the bass and sorts out higher pitches. The low-pass filter is in other words allowing frequencies from 0Hz to a chosen cut-off value. This cut-off value can be described in the following equation:
\begin{align*}
f_{cutoff}=\dfrac{1}{2 \pi RC}
\end{align*}
