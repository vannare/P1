\section{What is a differential equation?}
A differential equation is any equation, which includes a function and its derivative. These equations have function as the solution, rather than a number.  \\
The general form of an differential equation look like this
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}

A differential equation can either have general solution or a complete solution. When finding the general solution, there is no starting in which the constant $c$ can be found. The complete solution, there is a given starting point and the constant $c$ can be found, and there is not any unknown parts of the solution. \\

A differential equation would look something like this: $\frac{dy}{dx} = y$. This equation asks "What function is its own derivative?", which, is of course $y=e^x$. \\

A first order differential equation:
$$f(x)=4\frac{df}{dx} $$
A second order differential equation:
$$a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+b\frac{dy}{dx}+cy = 5\frac{dy}{dx}$$
And a third order differential equation:
$$\frac{d^3y}{dx^3} - 9\frac{d^2y}{dx} + 15\frac{dy}{dx} + 25y = 0$$
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Separable differential equations} \label{SDE}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Definition: Separable equation] 
    $$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)$$
    if the right-hand side of the equation can be expressed as   a function $h(x)$ that depends only on $x$ times a function $g(y)$ that depends only on $y$, then the differential equation is called separable.
   \end{tcolorbox}
As per this definition, a first order differential equation can be written as
\begin{align}
	\frac{dy}{dx}=h(x)g(y)
\end{align}
The equation can then be re-written and solved as follows, assuming that the integral exists
\begin{align}
	g(y)dy=h(x)dx
\end{align}
Then both side is integrated
 \begin{align}
 \int g(y)dy =\int h(x)dx   \\
 H(y)=G(x)+C
 \end{align}
 
Then the two constants is merged into one symbol $C$, this is the general solution to a differential equation. \citep{diffandcomplex}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black,title=Example using separable differential equation] 
What would the solution be to the following differential equation, with the given condition?
\begin{align*}
	\frac{dy}{dx} = 6y^2x, y(1)=\frac{1}{25}
\end{align*}
The first step is to rewrite the equation, such that it follows the form of (2.6):
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{y^2}\frac{dy}{dx}=6x
\end{align*}
Then rewrite the equation to fit the form of (2.7), and then integrate both sides the equations:
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{y^2}dy=&6x dx				\\
	\int \frac{1}{y^2}dy=&\int 6x dx		\\
	-\frac{1}{y}=&3x^2+c		
\end{align*}
Given the initial condition the integration constant can be found:
\begin{align*}
	-\frac{1}{\frac{1}{25}}=&3\cdot 1^2+c	\\
	c=&-28
\end{align*}
This would mean that y could be isolated, and the equation would be solved in this specific case:
\begin{align*}
	-\frac{1}{y}=&3x^2-28\\
	y=&-\frac{1}{3x^2-28}
\end{align*}
