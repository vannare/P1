\chapter{Introduction}
Most modern households contain many electronic devices, which have also become a natural part of everyday life. This raises the question: what do these electronic devices consist of? The answer is that all electronic devices contain an electrical circuit. This project will look more into a certain type of electrical circuits called a resistor-capacitor circuit (RC circuit). Almost all electronic devices include an RC circuit, since it is a fundamental element in signal processing. 
\\ \\
The flash of a camera uses a capacitor to quickly release charge, creating the short burst of light that lights up a picture.
\\ \\
In the music industry, most songs are modified and changed using different types of filters. This is possible due to RC circuits. Generally, an RC circuit takes a signal input and processes it to a wanted output. 
\\ \\
In other words; RC circuits are a part of many peopleâ€™s lives, and are therefore interesting to look more into. 
\\ \\
\textit{How does an RC circuit, charging and discharging of a capacitor, and how do filters work?}
