\section{Problem analysis}
All electronic devices contain electronic circuits. To be more specific, more or less all of them include a resistor-capacitor circuit (RC circuit). Since these circuits are fundamental in signal processing, understanding the concepts behind them are crucial. From simple definitions of current, voltage, resistors and capacitors, many more useful definitions can be derived by using differential equations, complex numbers, and the Laplace transform. The more advanced definitions are helpful when describing the use of a circuit. RC circuits are useful when there is too much noise on signals. In this case, it is possible to derive equations that help cut off unwanted frequencies. Cutting off frequencies can be done using high- and lowpass filters. 
\section{Problem Statement}
Where do differential equations appear in an RC-circuit? How is the Laplace transform useful when analyzing differential equations? How can a mathematical model of an RC-circuit be simulated and experimentally validated? How can certain noise-heavy frequencies be removed using RC-circuits? And can this process be automated using python?
