\chapter{Introduction}
Electronic devices have become a natural part of everyday life, and are found in most modern households. Most commonly, they contain a type of electrical circuit called a resistor-capacitor circuit (RC circuit). For example, RC circuits appear in camera flashes, where a capacitor quickly releases charge, which creates a short burst of light. Another example is in music production, where songs are modified or changed using different types of filters. The purpose of those filters is to allow certain frequencies to pass through, while cutting off the undesired ones. Two common types of filters are the high-pass and low-pass filters, which are used depending whether it is the high or low frequencies that need to be filtered out. The RC circuit provides the basis for those filters. Generally speaking, an RC circuit processes a signal input to a wanted output.

\textit{How does the charging and discharging of a capacitor in an RC circuit work, and how do high-pass and low-pass filters work?}

% How do RC circuits work, and what is their use as for filters and the charging/discharging of a capacitor?
