\chapter{Introduction}
Electronic devices have become a natural part of everyday life, and are found in most modern households. Most commonly, they all contain a type of electrical circuits called a resistor-capacitor circuit (RC circuit), since it is a fundamental element in signal processing. For example, RC circuits appear in camera flashes, where a capacitor quickly releases charge, which creates the short burst of light. Another example is the music industry, where songs are modified or changed using different types of filters. The purpose of those filters is to allow certain frequencies to pass through, while cutting off the undesired. Two common types of filters are the high-pass and low-pass filters, which are used depending on which frequencies are desired to be reduced. The resistor-capacitor circuit provides the basis for those filters. Generally speaking, an RC circuit processes a signal input to a wanted output.
