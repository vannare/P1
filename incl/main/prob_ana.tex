\section{Problem Statement}
Where do differential equations appear in an RC-circuit? How is the Laplace transform useful when analyzing differential equations? How can a mathematical model of an RC-circuit be simulated and experimentally validated? How can certain noise-heavy frequencies be removed using RC-circuits such as integrators or differentiators? And can this process be automated using python?
