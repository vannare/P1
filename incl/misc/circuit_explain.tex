\section{Electric charge}
The electrical charge (in coulombs, $C$) in a circuit stems from the negative charge electrons carry. This charge, when moved through a circuit, is what creates a current.   
\section{Current}
Current $(i)$ is the force that moves charge through a circuit. Current can be defined as an amount of charge moved over a time interval. This can be expressed as the following relation: \cite[p.~3]{bcircuit5}
\begin{align}
i(t)=\dfrac{dq(t)}{dt} \Leftrightarrow q(t)=\int i(t)\ dt,\label{I=dq/dt}
\end{align}
where $i(t)$ is the current (in ampere, $A$) at a given time $t$ (in seconds, $s$), and $q(t)$ is the function for charge at a given time $t$. $q(t)$ is measured in coulomb $(C)$.
\\
There exist two types of current: alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). Per definition, DC is a constant flow of current, while AC alternates (see figure \ref{fig:ACDC}). 
\begin{figure}[H] 
\input{fig/tikz/ADDC_fig}
\caption{Sinusoidal AC, and DC, versus time}
\label{fig:ACDC}
\end{figure}
\noindent
A sinusoidal AC can be described with the function: 
\begin{align}
i\left(t, f, A, \theta\right) =& A\cdot \sin{\left(2\pi ft + \theta\right)}, \nonumber
\\
=& A \cdot \sin{\left(\omega t + \theta\right)}, \label{eq:omega}
\end{align}
where $f$ is frequency (in hertz, $Hz$), which is cycles per second, $\omega = 2\pi f$ (in radians per second, $s^{-1}$), $t$ is time (in seconds, $s$), $A$ is amplitude (in ampere, $A$), and $\theta$ is the phase shift (in radians, unitless).
For ease of understanding, $\omega$ is sometimes used for notation instead of $2\pi f$. $\omega$ is also called the angular frequency of the signal.
Equation \eqref{eq:omega} with and without a phase-shift can be plotted as such:
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{fig/img/AC.png}
	\caption{Two ACs, $i(t)=A\sin(\omega t)$ and $i(t)=A\sin(\omega t+\theta)$ shown in a dotted blue line and a green, respectively. The current shown in green has been phase shifted by $\theta$. The currents have amplitude $A$, and period $P=f^{-1}$.}
\end{figure}
\noindent A certain type of AC exists, where the current is constant for half a period, and then turned off for the other half. This type of AC is called a step voltage, and the graph for this can be seen in figure \ref{fig:AC_step}.

\input{fig/tikz/AC_step_fig}

\label{fig:AC_step}
\end{figure}
\section{Voltage}
Voltage ($v$) is defined as the amount of work that it requires to move a charge of $1 C$ through an element. This is expressed in the following equation: \cite[p. 8]{bcircuit}
\begin{align*}
	v=\dfrac{dw}{dq},
\end{align*}
\\
where $w$ is the work (in watts, $W$).
\section{Resistor}
When a resistor, which is a passive element, is added to a circuit, it creates a resistance ($R$, in ohms, $\Omega$). Resistance makes it more difficult for the current to pass through the element. Resistance is defined as the proportional constant between current and voltage. The mathematical relation of this is given by: \cite[p.~22]{bcircuit5}
\begin{align} 
\label{Ohm}
v(t)=R\cdot i(t),\ R\geq0,
\end{align}
\section{Power} 
Power ($p$) measures energy exerted per second (in watts, $W$). Power can be expressed as: \cite[p. 22]{bcircuit5}.
\begin{align} 
\label{power}
p(t)=v(t)\cdot i(t).
\end{align}
By inserting this in equation \eqref{Ohm}, the following expression is found:
\begin{align}
p(t)=\dfrac{v^2(t)}{R}. \label{resistor:power}
\end{align}

\section{Capacitor}
A capacitor, which is a passive element, consists of two similar sized plates with a distance between them. When a current is applied to the circuit, the capacitor gets charged. The capacitance ($C$) is the amount of energy a capacitor can store, when it is fully charged. The capacitor gets charged, when a positive charge is transferred from one plate to another through the circuit.
\\
The capacitance is given by the following equation:
\begin{align*}
C=\dfrac{\epsilon_{0}A}{d},
\end{align*}
where $C$ is the capacitance (in farad, $F$), and $\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space, which is equal to $8.85 \cdot 10^{-12}                                                 \frac{F}{m}$. $A$ is the surface area of the plates (in square meters, $m^{2}$), and $d$ is the distance between the two plates (in meters, $m$).
\\
The charge of a capacitor across a voltage ($v$) and capacitance ($C$) is equal to: \cite[p.~253]{bcircuit5}
\begin{align}
\label{QCV}
q_C(t) = Cv_C(t).	
\end{align}
From \eqref{I=dq/dt}, current is defined as:
\begin{align*}
	i(t) = \frac{dq(t)}{dt}.
\end{align*}
The current across a capacitor is then:
\begin{align*}
	i_C(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\big(Cv_C(t)\big).
\end{align*}
For a capacitor with capacitance ($C$), the current across the capacitor can be written as:
\begin{align}
	i_C(t) = C\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}.\label{iC}
\end{align}
\section{Time constant}
When describing the charging and discharging of a capacitor, $\tau$ is a useful constant. The product of the resistance ($R$) and the capacitance ($C$) is called the time constant, $R \cdot C = \tau$.
