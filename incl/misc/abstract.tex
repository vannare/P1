The purpose of this project is to construct a mathematical model of the charging and discharging in an RC circuit, to show this mathematically, differential equations is introduced, as well as basic circuit theory to explain how the charging and the discharging of an RC circuit work. This project also contains how high and low-pass filters work and why these are relevant, to explain how these works, complex numbers and the Laplace transform is introduced to explain it mathematically.
