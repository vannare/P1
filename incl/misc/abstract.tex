The purpose of this project is to construct a mathematical model of the charging and discharging of a capacitor in an RC circuit. To show this mathematically, differential equations are introduced, as well as basic circuit theory to explain how the charging and discharging of capacitor works. This project also describes how high- and low-pass filters work. To explain how these work, complex numbers and the Laplace transform are introduced to explain it mathematically. This is all validated by conducting experiments and comparing them to theoretical models. In conclusion, the project has studied different aspects of RC circuits, which have been tested to be true. \\ \\
