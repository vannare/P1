The purpose of this project is to construct mathematical models describing the charging and discharging of a capacitor in an RC circuit, and the characteristics for high- and low-pass filters. To construct and explain these models, a further understanding of the following topics were needed; differential equations, basic circuit theory, complex numbers, and the Laplace transform. This is all validated by conducting experiments and comparing them to theoretical models. In conclusion, the project has studied different aspects of RC circuits, which have been tested to be true.
